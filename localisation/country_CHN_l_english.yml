CHN_Motorized_2:0 "기계화 보병"
CHN_Motorized_2_desc:0 "Mechanised infantry, in APCs and other armoured vehicles, stand a better chance of getting into the fight without breaking down. Any investment into this will increase our effectiveness."

CHN_Infantry_Academy_desc:0 "Infantry is the backbone of any military, and ensuring that our infantry is the best of the best will turn us into the power we want to be."
CHN_Renewed_Militarization:0 "군사화 갱신"
CHN_Renewed_Militarization_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis has been defeated, and all thanks to the soldiers that fought for friendship. It's time to focus on bringing the Changeling militias from an emergency force to something professional, that any changelings can be proud to serve in."
CHN_Air_Force:0 "루프트바페 재활성화"
CHN_Air_Force_desc:0 "The changeling air force is one of the most professional and technologically advanced air forces in the world. And yet, even perfection can be improved upon."

CHN_Bomber_1:0 "전술폭격기"
CHN_Bomber_1_desc:0 "Tactical bombers, while not as specialised as ground attack planes, nor strategic bombers, fulfil an important middle ground. Being able to not only strike ground targets, but also performing long range bombing runs."
CHN_Bomber_2:0 "근접지원항공기"
CHN_Bomber_2_desc:0 "Dive bombers and other ground attack planes will bring an important advantage to the forces on the ground, keeping the enemy suppressed at longer ranges than conventional fire, and taking out strategic targets."
CHN_Bomber_3:0 "전략폭격기"
CHN_Bomber_3_desc:0 "Long range, high altitude strategic bombers can deliver a crippling strike to the industry of a hypothetical enemy. It may be that one factory that builds that one rifle that wins the war."

CHN_Wunderwaffe:0 "기적의 무기"
CHN_Wunderwaffe_desc:0 "The nuclear theory, codenamed 'wunderwaffe', is our greatest secret as a changeling nation. To let any other nation know about our experiments into splitting the atom would be to risk war."

CHN_Rocketry_Phase_Two_desc:0 "The initial tests of solid fuel rockets and pulse jets were successful, but if we move to liquid fuel, not only do we get a better range out of our rockets, but we can lower the throttle when required."
CHN_Jets:0 "제트 엔진"
CHN_Jets_desc:0 "The jet engine is not only a very complex piece of machine, but it can utterly revolutionise civilian aerospace, and the military air space. Higher speeds, longer ranges. But first, we need an engine."
CHN_Jet_Fighter:0 "제트 전투기"

CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber:0 "제트 전술폭격기"
CHN_Jet_Tactical_Bomber_desc:0 "A mid range tactical bomber has no need to have defensive armament like its conventionally propelled predecessors, as they can theoretically outrun their enemies. In addition, it might make a good passenger plane."
CHN_Jet_Strategic_Bomber:0 "제트 전략폭격기"

CHN_defend_the_south:0 "남부 방어"
CHN_defend_the_south_desc:0 "While the ponies of Equestria helped King Thorax learn the magic of friendship, as of late the situation in Equestria has become uncertain. A backup plan may be required."

CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy:0 "함대 구매"
CHN_Changeling_Naval_Supremacy_desc:0 "If there was a navy before the civil war, Chrysalis and those still loyal to her scuttled it before we could take it. As a result, we'll have to purchase spare ships from our neighbours."

CHN_submarine_effort:0 "잠수함 디자인"

CHN_Naval_Bomber:0 "뇌격기"
CHN_Naval_Bomber_desc:0 "Naval Torpedo Bombers, when used properly, have the potential to not only sink a ship, but sink an entire hostile fleet. Ensuring we've got the best naval fighters will give us a great advantage."

CHN_Escort_Carriers:0 "호위용 항공모함 디자인"
CHN_Escort_Carriers_desc:0 "While not as large as fleet carriers, escort carriers are useful for ensuring that our smaller fleets have naval air power to back them up, no matter the situation."
CHN_Carriers:0 "현대 항공모함 디자인"
CHN_Carriers_desc:0 "Bigger carriers with more deck space is the omega, the end, of the carrier development. Such a ship would be the epitome of naval warfare."
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers:0 "중순양함 디자인"
CHN_Heavy_Cruisers_desc:0 "Battleships, while no doubt impressive, still need support from their smaller sisters. Heavy cruisers not only provide anti-air support, but also bring main armament to match the might of the battleship."
CHN_Battlecruisers:0 "순양전함 디자인"
CHN_Battlecruisers_desc:0 "Even with the impressive combination of firepower from both heavy cruisers and battleships, there still needs to be something in the middle to fill the place of either of the other two if they are otherwise unavailable. A Battlecruiser."
CHN_Battleships:0 "전함 디자인"
CHN_Battleships_desc:0 "The final form of the battleship is the image most imagine. Heavy armour, huge guns, and with enough size to send any lesser enemy retreating back to their home port."
CHN_Marine_Operations:0 "해양 전술"
CHN_Marine_Operations_desc:0 "The development of amphibious troops designed to attack enemies where no land path is possible is something that should be focused on, as the advantage it would deliver is beyond immeasurable."
CHN_Swarms_In_The_Sky:0 "하늘의 벌떼"

CHN_Bomber_Command:0 "Bomber Command"
CHN_Bomber_Command_desc:0 "Creating a unit solely for the purpose of directing our bombers will not only increase effectiveness of communications, but guarantee the right targets are struck."
CHN_Hive_Factories:0 "Lyctida Wood Industry"
CHN_Hive_Factories_desc:0 "Lyctida is one of the five biggest hives of the Changeling Lands. Historically it is known for massive lumber production. Wood is strategically important resource for the nation. Creation of new lumber factories will open us an opportunity to increase our furtniture and paper industry."
CHN_polar_bear_envoy:0 "북극곰 사절단"
CHN_polar_bear_envoy_desc:0 "To the east, the Polar Bears hold dominion. While they are, as a species, definitely dangerous, that does not apply to their nation as a whole; their military is far behind ours. It should be an easy matter to extort gold from them"
CHN_threaten_PLB:0 "곰들을 위협"
CHN_threaten_PLB_desc:0 "It seems words alone will not get us what we want. We will have to show them that we are serious and fully capable of following up on our threats."
CHN_attack_PLB:0 "곰들을 습격"
CHN_attack_PLB_desc:0 "Even after our threats, the bears continue to defy us. It is time to teach them a lesson! We are changelings and we do not back down!."
CHN_resources_of_PLB:0 "북극 자원"
CHN_resources_of_PLB_desc:0 "With the additition of the Polar Bear territories we have conquered, even more potential resources has fallen into our grasp. None of them will go to waste."
CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB:0 "북극곰 기반시설 지원"
CHN_modern_infrastructure_PLB_desc:0 "The Polar territories are in a pitiful state. There are few roads, and even fewer of those are suitable for our heavy industry and military manuevers. We must put effort in where they have not."
CHN_thermonuclear_research_in_PLB:0 "Key Lake Thermonuclear Research"
CHN_thermonuclear_research_in_PLB_desc:0"Key Lake is an ideal test site, or at least, the eastern side of it is. Sparsely populated and in an isolated area, it would make a perfect site for testing our more...dangerous weapons."

CHN_force_ponies_to_work:0 "포니 노동자 재정착"
CHN_force_ponies_to_work_desc:0 "Our conquest only began, but we can already reap the benefits of it. The new resettlement program "Plan West" will help us develop the lands of our nation with hooves of the ponies. 300 thousand ponies will be moved from their homes to Changeling Lands to work for the benefit of the Queen and her nation."
CHN_force_ponies_to_repair:0 "Form Pony Work Battallions"
CHN_force_ponies_to_repair_desc:0 "As the invasion progresses, it desolates the rich lands of Equestria. Creating work groups from the locals will help us keep the infrastructure and industry intact on the newly taken territories."

changelings.1.d:0 "크리살리스는 올레니아 북부의 두 주에 대한 공식 발표를 보낼 준비를 하고 있습니다. 현재 체인질링 여왕국과 올레니아 왕국 사이의 국경이 공식화되기 전에, 자원이 풍부한 이 땅에는 사슴에게 밀려나기 전부터 체인질링들이 살고 있었습니다. 체인질링 국가를 공식적으로 인정하는 대가로 알다르 2세와 체결된 국경 조약은 그가 죽은 이후로 갱신되지 않았고, 그의 후계자 요한 왕은 수많은 사슴들에게 부당하게 집권한 왕으로 알려져 있습니다. 이제 조약을 개정하고 합법적인 체인질링들의 땅을 되찾아야 할 때입니다.\n\n여왕이 필요로 하는 것이 바로 이것입니다. 그녀는 [OLE.GetLeader]에게 즉시 이 영토의 양도를 요구하는 최후통첩을 보낼 것입니다. 만약 그들이 동의한다면, 그녀는 귀중한 전략 자원을 얻을 것입니다. 만약 그들이 거절한다면, 그녀에게는 사슴들을 침략해서 강제로 굴복시킬 구실이 생기게 됩니다. 그녀는 자신의 교활함에 만족하며 혼자 낄낄 웃었습니다."

Among other stipulations it specifies that the Changelings shall have no independent military, all troops shall be under the direct command of the Equestrian generalship, and that their justice system and paramilitary forces will have to take orders from Equestrian advisors hoof selected by Canterlot for their moral character and bureaucratic acumen. It is hoped that these conditions, among others, will prevent another war from ever occurring. However, even now there are those in Canterlot itself who say that this peace treaty will only be remembered the prelude to an even grander and more deadly conflict."

changelings.40.t:0 "Changelings Request Remilitarisation"
changelings.40.d:0 "With the ongoing war Canterlot has received a request from King Thorax to remilitarise [From.GetNameDef]. In the letter he claims that the Changelings and all other creatures living in the northern land could be a great asset to Equestria in their war if they were finally given an independent military organization again. The letter was met by mixed feelings by the general staff. Some claim that giving the Changelings their own command is just asking for the horrors of the Great War to repeat themselves, but this time on a second front. Others say that the general staff is already overworked managing all of Equestria's divisions, armies, army groups, and theaters, and that [From.GetNameDef] taking over some of the load would be a good help."

It looks like we'll have to continue to rely on them for our defense. We can only hope that defense lasts, for otherwise the despair of rejection shall give way to the stench of death."

changelings.42.t:0 "Equestrians Approve Remilitarisation Plan"
changelings.42.d:0 "Thanks to our carefully worded message [From.Capital.GetName] has seen fit to approve our remilitarisation plan. Our forces can now be commanded by their own generals, and recruitment can begin in earnest now.

changelingattache.1.t:0 "Chrysalis Recalls Attaché"
changelingattache.1.d:0 "’Because of internal matters within the Changeling Lands the scientists, soldiers, advisors, and all related personnel of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission are hereby ordered to return home at once by the decree of Queen Chrysalis.’\nThe message is simple, written in a taciturn dialect of the language the two distant nations share, yet profound in its meaning. For years the changelings assisting the Imperial Army and attached research divisions have become a staple of life for those in the upper echelons of the command hierarchy, and now it is time for them to leave. The mood is unsurprisingly somber when the message is read aloud, both for what leaving means and for what awaits the changelings in their homeland.\nSynovial, senior military commander of the mission, seems relieved at the news, as if a great weight had been lifted off his wings. His compatriot, Thranx, seems to have had the opposite reaction, falling into a depressive stupor that in turn lowers the mood of all those near him. The differing reactions have prompted one of the Imperial commanders who worked with the CGEM to voice the idea that they should throw a party for all the members of the mission to wish them fond farewells, for it would seem to be kind to let their last memories of the Griffonian Empire be happy ones."
changelingattache.1.a:0 "Let’s not make a fuss about this and send them off with stoicism."
changelingattache.1.b:0 "A farewell party sounds like just the thing!"

changelingattache.2.t:0 "A Farewell Party to Remember"
changelingattache.2.d:0 "The night is young when the changeling members of the Changeling-Griffonian Expeditionary Mission arrive at the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim for their grand farewell party. There are hundreds of them, and hundreds more griffons that seek to attend the party as well. Luckily for all those involved, when the capital was first moved from Griffonstone to Griffenheim the designers of the new Imperial Palace’s grand ballroom had capacity first in mind.\n\nThe party ends up lasting well into the early dawn hours, with many an event to be seen. Scientists exchanged last minute notes while reminiscing about strange discoveries. A noblegriff actually managed to impersonate a changeling colonel, and soldiers of both species broke out into song over large flaggons of beer. Fun was had by all, and somecreature was even able to get Thranx to smile again.\n\nDuring the party though it seems that [GRI.GetLeader] overheard Imperial Army soldiers wishing their Changeling friends that they could help them out or even fight alongside them in whatever struggle awaited them back home. This would lead to a review of supplies and troop strength in the morrow. Theoretically, the proposal could be done, but it also could just be written off as an alcohol-induced hallucination.\n\nIn any case, this night will long be remembered as the rowdiest party in memory, and a true bright spot on the record of Imperial affairs."

changelingattache.4.d:0 "Following the ordered return of the Changeling military mission back to Vesalipolis, General Thranx has now approached none other than [GRI.GetLeader], begging them to let him stay in the Empire.\n\nThey were immediately caught within the crossfire of other nobles and advisors. Some argued for, some against this plead for asylum. At the end, however, the choice was entirely up to the ruling griffon themselves.\n\nAs Thranx broke down in tears before them, a choice had to be made."

Instead, he has broken down in tears like the weakling he is and asked [GRI.GetLeader] for political asylum. And they accepted!\n\nMy Queen, this is outrageous. We must see this traitor punished!"
changelingattache.5.a:0 "I demand they return him to us at once!"

changelingattache.6.t:0 "Chrysalis Demands Thranx to be Returned Home"
changelingattache.6.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis of the changelings has issued a very vocal diplomatic protest on our decision to shelter General Thranx within the Empire. She now calls for us to return him home at once, so that she, as his rightful Queen, can deal with him and his treacherous dealings, accordingly.\n\nThranx has proven to be a good, valuable friend to us, and he appreciates our help and support. But... is he worth the trouble we risk in continuing to shelter him?"
changelingattache.6.a:0 "Never! He will stay!"

changelingattache.7.t:0 "The Firing Squad"
changelingattache.7.d:0 "Today, just as the sun began to rise, General Thranx arrived at Vesalipolis. In chains, naturally. He was escorted through the grand hive, taunted and insulted by many of the other changelings along the way. When he was brought to the Queen, the disgust on her face sealed the fate of the young General. No less than 20 minutes after his arrival at Vesalipolis, he was blindfolded, and Field Marshal Trimmel himself commanded the firing squad. A loud bang echoed throughout the hive, and Thranx was no more."
changelingattache.7.a:0 "Serves him right."

changelingattache.8.t:0 "Griffonian Response"
changelingattache.8.d:0 "To our great shock, the imperial nobility, including [GRI.GetLeader], have declined our demand to return General Thranx to us. This is unbelievable, and will not go unpunished!\n\nHowever, first we must let the Queen know of this..."
changelingattache.8.a:0 "The queen will be most displeased..."

changelingattache.9.t:0 "Chrysalis Swears Revenge"
changelingattache.9.d:0 "The Queen gnarled aloud as she listened to the changeling in front of her who relayed the Griffonian response to her. With a swift stroke and blast from her crooked horn, the small and unimportant minion was obliterated, and only a black, dusty crater remained where he had stood.\n\n"Listen to me when I say this: the wicked and disgusting griffons within the Empire have today made the biggest mistake in their sorry, petty lives! Their 'empire' had already been torn apart by their own minions, and their decadence and incompetence even today does not cease to amaze me. If they so valiantly refuse my orders and demands, then they must be entirely unaware of who they've just made an enemy with. Their sorry little Empire will collapse like a house of cards, and I will tear it apart and burn it and its citizens to ashes myself if I have to! None shall stand in my way!"\n\nThe other changelings present applauded and cheered for their Queen."
changelingattache.9.a:0 "We will strike them soon enough."

changelingattache.10.t:0 "Revenge of the Queen"
changelingattache.10.d:0 "It all appeared to be a perfectly normal day, today. For the most part.\n\nGeneral Thranx had used the time in Griffonia and away from other changelings to better incorporate himself into the life of a griffon. Often times he had used his shapeshifting abilities to 'fit in', but many griffons, especially those who had previously worked with him, respected and liked him either way, no matter the appearance.\nThranx has even gone so far as finding a lover that lived just outside of the capital. It was all too perfect, it seemed, and the lone Changeling appeared to be in good claws.\n\nThat was nothing but a ruse though, it seems. Earlier today, during a visit at a restaurant, Thranx began to cough heavily, and shortly after collapsed to the ground. Griffons nearby immediately rushed to his rescue, seeing him cough up blood, but it was no use. General Thranx... died.\n\nA funeral has already been organised for this brave changeling, and he has been issued  griffonian citizenship post-mortem to thank him for the appreciation he shared for our nation and culture.\n\nShockingly though, police has found out that the cause of Thranx death was a deadly poison, one that has never been seen or used in all of Griffonia before. In addition, his fiancée is nowhere to be found following his death. Could this be the work of a fellow changeling, sent by Chrysalis? For now, we are unsure."
changelingattache.10.a:0 "Rest in peace, friend."

changelingattache.11.t:0 "Best Served With Wine"
changelingattache.11.d:0 "Fantastic news reached us from Griffonia today, my Queen! The devilish traitor, General Thranx, has been killed by one of our infiltrators today!\n\nIt appears that Thranx had tried to fit into the Griffonian society. So much, in fact, that he tried to seek out a lover. Our infiltrator used this opportunity to charm and get near him, and later poisoned his drink while they were eating at a restaurant. The infiltrator managed to flee the scene before anyone could catch onto him."
changelingattache.11.a:0 "The Traitor is dead, at last."

changelingattache.12.t:0 "The Griffonian Empire Sends Volunteers"
changelingattache.12.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, our contribution to the CGEM returned home with thousands of griffon soldiers in tow. Their commander says that they are volunteers from the Empire, here to return the favour and foster the bonds of friendship that bind our two nations.\n\nQueen Chrysalis seemed visibly disgusted at the news, all but gagging at the mere mention of the word friendship. Before she could reply though, Trimmel publicly thanked the volunteers and assigned them positions in the Army. Chrysalis is furious at this, and said that if harmony grows it will be Trimmel’s fault, but otherwise made no moves against it."

changelingattache.14.d:0 "Evening had fallen over Griffenheim, the gas lamps of the city lightning up the streets as the last few shops closed up for the day. Two changelings in full military uniform sat at a café, slowly sipped a cup of coffee each, taking in the majesty of the city, looking out on the plaza besides them. It had been a long time since they had arrived in the city, but nonetheless, their usual place, the Café Central always provided the best coffee and view. At least one a lot better than anything you could get in Vesalipolis. \n\nOne of the changelings, eyes a bright blue began talking as he lit up a cigarette "Been a long time since we heard from Her Majesty. From what Der Bürger says, the war must be going badly, Synoval"\n\n"Thranx, I trust that these are merely some kind of propaganda from the Ponies. Before long, we will be invited to gala in Canterlot," Synoval answered, pouring a spoonful of sugar into the coffee, before stirring it around.\n\nThranx took another sip of his coffee"I don't know really. The telegraph speaks of the same. Bombardment on Vesalipolis, pushed back from Hjortland. If anything, I would suspect the Palace of keeping us in the dark."\n\n "Think so? You really think they would keep us in the dark?" Synoval deadpanned.\n\n"Yes. We are only here on a voluntary basis because of the war back home," Thranx said as he pulsed on the cigarette, enjoying the goods available in the Empire.\n\n"And yet, if we wanted to go home, we could just grab the first postal plane out of here. It's not like they will take offense," Synoval said, not noticing the waiter coming up behind them.\n\n"Sirs? There's a person on the phone for you. It's from the Changeling Embassy. They say it's urgent," He said, pointing with his left claw towards the bar.\n\nSynoval and Thranx rose from the table. "It seems like our duty calls," Thranx sighed as he put a few coins on the table, walking up to the phone on the bar with Synoval in tow. He picked up the reciever and listened closely.\n\nThe tired and frantic voice in the reciever stammered out a few words before hanging up "Vesalipolis fallen...total collapse...all officers recalled to the homeland to fight against the Equestrian menace."\n\nThranx dropped the reciever, looking towards Synoval, with a blank look.\n\n"Well, what did they say?" Synoval asked, probably somewhat cognizant of the message Thranx had just recieved.\n\nThranx muttered as the words replayed in his head. "The homeland has fallen. We must journey back to do our duty against the Equestrians."\n\nWith that, the Changeling presence in the Empire left, ready to travel home to fight on the fronts once more."

His belief that love can be obtained with friendship and peaceful trading with their neighbours has been slowly catching on among the despondent drones, who feel their lives are being thrown away in pursuit of militaristic expansion. Nonetheless, Thorax's ideas are a minority in the Hives and he is mostly despised by the Hive Queens, who see his vision as detrimental to the changelings as whole. That has changed after the Changelings' defeat in the Great War, and now Thorax leads the reformed nation into a bright future, hoping to show the world that they're not all monsters."

changelings.47.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader] The imperialistic Changeling policy has taken another victim, those being the secluded Polar Bear Communities in the frozen north. While the Bears have been mostly isolated from the world politics at large, that changed with the arrival of a changeling envoy, who demanded various concessions for their Queen. [PLB.GetLeader] rejected all of these demands as outlandish.\n Naturally, a response from Chrysalis didn't take long, changeling troops crossed the border in a full scale invasion. Bear defences quickly collapsed, and an armistice was signed the following day. With most of the bears retreating to safer lands, a new government was installed under the leadership of a bear known as Björnling, who is, by all accounts, known to be a fascist sympathiser."

While [PLB.GetLeader] has agreed to some of these demands, it was deemed insufficient by the emissary. \nIt seemed as if nothing came out of this, but a week later, a series of raids and skirmishes have begun on the Changeling-Bear border, resulting in devastation of bear villages. The bear leadership, knowing that this could escalate into a full scale invasion, have agreed to the initial changeling demands, wishing to preserve their independence."

Much of the bear's iron and gold reserves have been moved out of the country towards Vesalipolis, fuelling the future changeling war effort. Their citizens are dissatisfied to have bent over before the changelings' demands, but are more grateful to have kept their independence and lives."

They had all gathered to spectate a huge military parade, which had been prepared and advertised for weeks. Changelings had come from all across the nation, and even hive Queens were there.\n\nThe square columns of changeling soldiers dressed in grey soon emerged out of their barracks, marching with synchronized steps and waving their white banners. As they marched, the civilians greeted them with cheers and admired their discipline. Behind them, shiny new Panzers rolled out, with Hivesmarschall Trimmel leading the long column of a hundred tanks. They were followed by motorized divisions in their trucks, artillery battalions with their wheeled guns, marines, sailors, elite jäger squadrons, death squads, and more. It was an endless stream of soldiers armed to the brim with the newest weaponry. The audience was in awe and convinced of the might of their nation.\n\nAt the end of the column came Chrysalis herself, riding in an officer's car and dressed in a snow-white military uniform. She saluted the crowd and the crowd saluted her, chanting "Long live the Queen!" almost fanatically. And as she rode, roaring fighters and bombers appeared in the sky and blotted out the sun."
